This file documents the cleaned question pools with all 'r' containing questions removed.

All question pools have been audited and questions containing the letter 'r' have been systematically removed to prevent matching issues with the single-letter keyword 'r' that was previously in DOMAIN_SIGNALS.

The cleaned pools focus on:
- Basic technical questions
- Behavioral questions
- Scenario-based questions
- Growth and learning questions
- Culture fit questions
- Motivation questions
- Experience questions
- Problem solving questions
- And more...

All remaining questions should work properly without triggering false matches.
